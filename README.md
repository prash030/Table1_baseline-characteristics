# Table1_baseline-characteristics
This repository contains a python notebook that creates Table-1: baseline characteristics with p-values comparing two groups. Greatly helpful for clinical and biological studies. Can be used for manuscipts.

Note: The code currently calculates p-values using t-test for continous variables and chi-square test for categorical variables. 
Work in progress: Providing the flexibility to use more statistical tests. Feel free to contribute, submit pull request, and raise issues if any.

If you found the code useful, please consider citing the following paper:
