# Table1_baseline-characteristics
This repository contains an ipynb notebook that creates Table-1: baseline characteristics with p-values comparing two groups. Greatly helpful for clinical and biological studies. Can be used for manuscipts.

Note: The code currently calculates p-values using t-test for continous variables and chi-square test for categorical variables. 
Work in progress: Providing the flexibility to use more statistical tests. If you have ideas for that, please submit pull request. 
Feel free to raise issues if any.
