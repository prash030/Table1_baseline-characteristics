# Table1_baseline-characteristics
This repository contains an ipynb notebook that creates Table-1: baseline characteristics with p-values comparing two groups. Greatly helpful for clinical and biological studies. Can be used for manuscipts.

Note: The p-values function uses t-test for continous variables and chi-square test for categorical variables by default.

Feel free to raise issues or pull requests.
